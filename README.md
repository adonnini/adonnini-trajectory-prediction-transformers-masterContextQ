## Set up
a) Create a working directory to hold the contents of this ```adonnini-trajectory-prediction-transformers-masterContextQ``` repository.

b) Add executorch to the working directory following the instructions in
https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/getting-started-setup.html

c) In the executorch directory, run the following commands to install packages necessary in order to train the model
- pip install wheel
- python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
- pip install -U pip setuptools ruamel-yaml pyyaml PyYaml
- pip install matplotlib scikit-learn scipy pydantic
- pip install geopandas pygeos transformers gensim

## Running the Training Loop and Executorch Model Export
1. Create a \models folder in the working directory.
2. In the working directory, execute the train-minimum.py script. 

Validation after every epoch has been disabled as it intefered with torchscript execution (when torchscript was enabled).

## Notes - Please Read
i) I am new to Python. Please bear in this mind as you will probably find some (many) of the things I did amateurish/beginner.

ii) ```train-minimum.py``` is (very) messy. I have been using it as a sandbox. There are many lines which are commented out. They are either instructions, notes, or code which I tried and disabled because it did not work, or code I used to test some ideas which I abandoned. I am sorry as this will make navigating/understanding train-minimum.py (more) difficult to navigate.

iii) Although they should work, I did not test the instructions in this ```README.md``` file. However I did run ```train-minimum.py``` on my system in a working direcotry set up as described above producing the execution failure as described in
https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/issues/1350
